1) THIS IS AWESOME.
2) BUILD THE ADMIN PAGE.
3) BUILD THE SIMILAR PATTERN FOR ADMIN AS USER.
4) ADD ONLY THE LOGIN PART AGAIN. THAT IS FUCKING COPY PASTE.
5) ADD THE REGISTRATION FOR THE NEW USER AT THE FUCKING ADMIN SITE.
6) ADD THE FUCKING USERS LIST.
7) ADD THE EDIT USER DETAILS.
8) ADD THE FUCKING DELETE USER OPTION.
9) ADD THE BLOCK USER PART.
10) ADD THE VIEW ALL TASK FOR THE ADMIN.
11) THAT'S PRETTY FUCKING DONE FOR THE FUCKER ADMIN.

ISSUES AT THE PRESENT:-

1) NOT ABLE TO GO TO THE DESCRIPTIVE MESSSAGE INSIDE THE USER SIDE.

CHALLENGES AT THE PRESENT-
1) DO I CREATE A NEW TABLE FOR ADMIN?
2) I DONT THINK I NEED A NEW TABLE FOR ADMIN DETAILS.
3) A BETTER SOLUTION IS TO ADD A COLUMN IN USERS TABLE LIKE USER TYPE. THOUGH A HIDDEN INPUT IT STILL WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR ADDING TO ADMIN AND USER LOGIN. THIS WOULD HELP IN DEVELOPING SPECIAL TEMPORARY ADMIN RIGHTS.
4) ADMIN- LOGIN USING USERTYPE 1 AND USER LOGIN VIA USERTYPE 0.
5) ADMIN- VIEW ALL USERS, EDIT USERS, DELETE AND  BLOCK USERS.

THAT'S IT. I GUESS. WILL BE ADDING MORE IF NECESSARY.
